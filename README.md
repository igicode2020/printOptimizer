# Print Optimizer

To select prints, add the file IDs of the models you want to print to `task.txt`. If you want to print a model multiple times, add its file ID multiple times to `task.txt`.

Make sure to install all requirements in `requirements.txt`

All file IDs should be taken from `models.txt`.

All the printers and their compabilities are found in `printers.json`

No input requirements are neccesary besides `task.txt`, simply run the python script, `main.py` by itself.

The output will be found in `results.txt`
